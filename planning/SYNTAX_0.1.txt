Stuff from Lua:

- Global scope
- Portability

Stuff from JavaScript:

- Arrays and Objects
- Function binding to `this`
- `typeof`

Stuff from Kotlin:

- `if`/`else` (both as statement and expression)
- `for`
- `while`
- `do`/`while`
    - `do` without `while` is valid, works like kotlin's `run {}`
- `try`/`catch`/`finally`
    - no type restrictions, like JS.
- `break`/`continue`
- `vararg`
- Vals, Vars
- Booleans, Null, Strings (with support for raw and template strings), Numbers, etc
- Access/assignments of variables
- Function invocation
- Property access/assignment
- Null-safe operator (`?.`)
- Not-null assertion operator (`!!`)
- Unary operations: `!a`, `+a`, `-a`
- Binary operations:
    - `a+b`, `a-b`, `a*b`, `a/b`, `a%b`
    - `a==b`, `a!=b`, `a&&b`, `a||b`, `a<b`, `a<=b`, `a>b`, `a>=b`
    - `a ?: b`, `a in b`, `a !in b`, `a..b`
- Function declaration (named, anonymous)
- Subscript access/assignment (`a[...]`, `a[...] = b`)
- Equality rules

Custom stuff:

- `unit` looks like Kotlin's `kotlin.Unit` but works more like `undefined`.
    - NOT implementing `{}.anything == unit`. Ever.
- `is` runtimely de-sugars from `A is B` to `typeof A == B`
- `return`/`throw` will work more like JS and less like Kotlin.
- `when` will be like Kotlin as much as pratt-parsing allow us to.
- `break` on `while` works like a loop `return`. Otherwise `while` returns `unit`.
- Use symbols (like JS). `operator fun` are shortcuts to underlying symbols
